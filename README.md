# VeriGen 
### A Verilog Fuzzer with a focus on the Generate and Hierarchical Naming constructs
*A better description is coming soon*

---

TBD:
- More complex Generate construct usage (requires retooling of `ast.hpp` for a true AST based generate implementation)
- Support for other software tools (Vivado)
- Stop Verilog files being generated outside the `build/` directory initially before being copied to their respective session
